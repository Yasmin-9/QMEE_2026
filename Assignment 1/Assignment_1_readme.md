For this week's assignment, I will use the output of a blast query of Xenopus laevis coding sequences against Xenopus longipes whole genome (organized in contigs)

The biological relevance of it is I'd like to explore the gene content from the laevis query of the longipes contigs. This would be one of the exploratory methods to help potentially canadidate contigs for sex-linkage.  

Calculations to perform: The final goal of the computations is to calculate the gene density of the contigs. Several steps are needed to achieve this including merging the blast output with the full contig lengths. Other metrics on the blast hits were computed for reference in future work.
